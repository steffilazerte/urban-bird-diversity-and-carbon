**Abstract**: 
Cities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of biodiversity loss and climate change. Urban greenspaces are important ecosystems that can conserve biodiversity and help offset the carbon footprint of urban areas. However, despite large-scale tree planting and restoration initiatives in cities, it is not well known where trees or vegetation should be planted or restored to achieve multiple benefits. We considered urban greenspaces as nature-based solutions for urban climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation planning. Using bivariate mapping, we examined the spatial synergies and trade-offs between bird functional diversity and carbon storage in ten Canadian cities spanning a gradient of geography and population, and modelled the relationships between vegetation attributes and both bird diversity and amount of carbon. We found carbon and biodiversity are weakly positively correlated across the ten cities, however, this relationship varied in strength, direction and significance. Our maps highlight areas within our target cities where greenspaces could be managed, restored, or protected to maximize carbon storage and conserve biodiversity. Nationwide, our results also show that forest management strategies that promote increases in canopy cover and the proportion of needle-leaved species in urban greenspaces are potential win-win strategies for biodiversity and carbon. Our study shows NbS strategies are not always generalizable across regions. National policies should guide municipalities and cities using regional priorities and science advice, since a NbS promoting biodiversity in one region may, in fact, reduce it in another.

These interactive results are a companion to the above study. 
Maps on these pages show the results of bivariate analysis along with other features of urban greenspaces
across various Canadian cities.

**Tabs:** Tabs at across top of this page indicate which cities you can explore. 

**Maps:** Each tab shows a map with the bivariate analysis on the left and a series of urban greenspace features mapped
on the right. You can **hover** over tiles for more information and **pan** and **zoom** to 
more closely explore particular areas.

**Details:** For a detailed overview of the data and how to use bivariate maps, see the [Details](#details) tab.

## Column 1

:::{.card title="Understanding bivariate legends"}

A bivariate map uses two colours combined to show how two different variables 
interact on the landscape.

Here we explore carbon storage and bird functional species richness in urban greenspaces.

Each variable is binned into 5 different categories (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Then each site is 
assigned a combined score, for example, a site with a 1-1 score indicates that it 
has low carbon storage as well as low species richness.

This in turn results in identifying hotspots, coldspots, and areas high in one of
the two variables.

- **Hotspots** - Areas important for conservation
- **Coldspots** - Areas important for restoration
- **Trade-off Areas** - Areas which need more research and are important for management to keep biodiversity or carbon storage high
